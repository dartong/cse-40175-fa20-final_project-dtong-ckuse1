You specifically are an expert at devising algorithms to target web consumers based on their available data. Today, walking into work, someone lets you know that your boss is looking to speak with you at some point. You shrug your things off at your desk and wander over to the boss's office. Your boss calls you in and asks you to sit down, and you do as you're told. Then, the boss changes everything. She begins to explain that she wants you to join a team - a secret team operating within the company, which holds the task of personally looking through illegally gathered consumer data, and devising the best possible algorithms from them. Since your skills are exactly what they need, they want you.

Plus, the consumer data isn't really going to anything bad, so they're barely even victims.\n", "Of course, you would still be stealing consumer data, which is illegal and just doesn't sit right with you.
